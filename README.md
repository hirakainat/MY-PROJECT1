THIS IS MY OOP ASSIGNMENT NO 2 ON THE TOPIC OF THE OPERATOR OVERLOADING WHICH HELPS ME A LOT IN UNDERSTANDING THE TOPICS ESPECIALLY WHEN I NEED TO TACKLE WITH STRINGS AND ARRAYS
This project is an implementation of a custom mystring class in C++, demonstrating essential concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on operator overloading. The mystring class provides various functionalities similar to the std::string class, designed to deepen understanding of character arrays, dynamic memory allocation, and operator overloading. Key features include:

Dynamic Memory Management: Efficient handling of dynamic character arrays.
Operator Overloading: Overloads common operators (+, =, <<, >>, [], !, and ()), supporting string concatenation, assignment, comparison, substring extraction, and character manipulation.
Custom Utility Functions: Implements helper functions for string copying, concatenation, and comparison.
Error Handling: Index range checks in the [] operator and boundary checks in the substring function.
